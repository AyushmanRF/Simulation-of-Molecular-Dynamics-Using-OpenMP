# Simulation-of-Molecular-Dynamics-Using-OpenMP
Parallel and Distributed Computing Project

Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation is a well progressed numerical method that shows the use of a suitable algorithm to solve the classical equations of motion for atoms 
relating with a known inter atomic potential. Techniques for MD simulation are also ideal for researching surface phenomena because they provide a qualitative understanding 
of surface dynamics and structure. In order to save time, we shall parallelize the serial simulation of molecular dynamics using **OpenMp**
